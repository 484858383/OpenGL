# Minecraft 
work in progress minecraft clone using a base library which loads GLAD and GLFW
thanks to TheCherno for providing the library: https://github.com/TheCherno/OpenGL
## Goals (at the moment)
-terrain generator using perlin noise (done)

-simulate basic physics (done)

-simulate realistic lighting and shadows (basic lighting is done, shadows are not)

#this project is no longer being worked on for the time being
-i am happy where this project is, even though i did not get to complete the lighting,
 i have come to the conclusion that in order to perfect these systems in this project
 would take alot of time and i would be better off trying these things in a new project
 as i am still learning alot.
-for my first 3d game (not much gameplay) i am happy where it is.
